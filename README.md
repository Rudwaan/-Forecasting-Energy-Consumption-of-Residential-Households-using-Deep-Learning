# -Forecasting-Energy-Consumption-of-Residential-Households-using-Deep-Learning

As the urban populations grow, the demand for energy escalates and residential household constitute a substantial proportion of the energy consumption leading to environmental impact and economic expenditures. Hence managing energy consumption efficiently has become vital part of energy suppliers and policymakers. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, this research aim is to build a vigorous Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Random Forest model for the energy consumption prediction of London residential households. This will be implemented among diverse featured dataset of Londonâ€™s Smart meter data spanning multiple years and also including meteorological and government holidays which will elevate the performance and prediction capability of the model. Additionally, pre-processing steps and feature selection techniques such as PCA are implemented to ensure high quality inputs are delivered to GRU model. 

The GRU model is designed to capture non-linear and complex patterns in the data leveraging its ability to handle vanishing gradient problem. Consequently, Random Forest model will serve as a benchmark offering valuable insights through its ensemble learning approach. The model will be assessed based on R2, RMSE, MAE, MSE evaluation metrics. The GRU model demonstrates superior performance in capturing the dynamic nature of energy consumption patterns as compared to Random Forest, achieving lower error rate during evaluation and higher R2. The results indicate that deep learning models, particularly GRUs, are highly effective in capturing complex patterns for forecasting energy consumption in urban areas. This research contributes to the growing knowledge of energy consumption management and provides a structured framework for future studies aiming to enhance energy forecasting accuracy using advanced deep learning techniques.
